I used the python library located at https://github.com/negregg/seng560 for this assignment.

The application uses a simple command line interface, and can be executed by browsing to the directory that you've saved seng560CalcWithnatemath.py and running it with python <filename>

The library was very easy to use and required no modification to function.  The only hiccup is that the library required floating point numbers to execute, which I wasn't initially casting.  After making that change to the code there were no issues.
